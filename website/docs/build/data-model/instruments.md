# Instruments

<Lead>An instrument is <em>where the money comes from</em> — a bank account, a debit card, or a loyalty balance. Like payment options, instruments follow a resolve-then-trust pattern: inputs arrive as references or provided details, and only a <strong>verified</strong> instrument can fund a payment.</Lead>

## The hierarchy

```kotlin
sealed interface Instrument                                  // the umbrella

sealed interface InstrumentReference : Instrument            // must be resolved first
sealed interface ProvidedInstrument : Instrument             // trusted upstream input

sealed interface VerifiedInstrument : Instrument {           // can move value
    val id: EnrollmentIdentifier
}
sealed interface RegulatedInstrument : VerifiedInstrument {  // fiat — token + fingerprint required
    val instrumentToken: InstrumentToken
    val fingerprint: Fingerprint
}
sealed interface ContractInstrument : VerifiedInstrument     // non-fiat (contractual value)
```

Three ways in, one way to fund:

- **`EnrollmentInstrument`** *(reference)* — just an enrollment id; the full details live in the enrollment system and get resolved.
- **`FinancialInstitutionProvidedInstrument`** / **`DebitCardProvidedInstrument`** *(provided)* — account or card details that arrived on a trusted transaction event (the inbound path), taken as authoritative input.
- Resolution functions (`toFinancialInstitutionInstrument(…)`, `toDebitCardInstrument(…)`, `toLoyaltyInstrument()`) turn either of those into a **verified** instrument. The [Verified payment states](./payment.md) accept nothing less.

The `RegulatedInstrument` split matters for compliance: anything that touches real money must carry a secure **token** and a **fingerprint** — sensitive numbers are encrypted or redacted, never raw. `ContractInstrument` covers value that isn't fiat, like loyalty points paying down a card balance.

## The three verified instruments

**`FinancialInstitutionInstrument`** — a bank account. Carries the institution code, redacted and (optionally) encrypted account numbers, and two enums that make it work internationally:

| `FIAccountType` | `IdentificationSchema` (how the account is identified) |
| --- | --- |
| `SAVINGS` | `SORT_CODE_AND_BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER` — UK |
| `CHECKING` | `ROUTING_NUMBER_AND_BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER` — US |
| `CURRENT` | `TRANSIT_NUMBER_AND_BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER` — Canada |
| `CONSUMER_SAVINGS` | `IFSC_CODE_AND_BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER` — India |
| `CONSUMER_CHECKING` | `BSB_NUMBER_AND_BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER` — Australia |
| `BUSINESS_SAVINGS` | `BANK_CODE_AND_BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER` — generic international |
| `BUSINESS_CHECKING` | `BANK_IDENTIFIER_CODE_AND_INTERNATIONAL_BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER` — SEPA / BIC + IBAN |
| | `CLABE` — Mexico |

*(Two independent enums — the columns aren't paired.)* One new market usually means one new `IdentificationSchema` value, not a new instrument type — that's the point of the design.

**`DebitCardInstrument`** — a debit card: redacted card number for display, optionally an encrypted card number, and an expiry serialized as `MM/yyyy` (`@field:JsonFormat(shape = STRING, pattern = "MM/yyyy") val expiryDate: YearMonth?`).

**`LoyaltyInstrument`** — the contract instrument: an enrollment id and nothing else, because the loyalty program owns the balance.

:::warning Two different "account types"
`FIAccountType` here describes the **funding bank account** — savings vs checking. It is *not* the `accountType` **dimension** (`CONSUMER` / `CORPORATE` / `SMALL_BUSINESS`) that routes processing, which lives on the Amex `Account`, not on the instrument. Conflating them is the easiest mistake to make in this part of the codebase.
